Description of the Use Case 

Ximiq was founded in 2013 as a Consulting Firm with the objective of working with customer as partners. The aim of Ximiq is to align Business and IT. This is done through Enterprise Architecture Management. While supporting one of our customers in EAM, we realized the need to automatically generate reports from the Enterprise Architecture Modelling Tools. At this point, Ximiq developed the ADOIT Report Generator for Microsoft Word. Thanks to the ADOIT Report Generator for Word customers are able to flexibly and quickly create architecture documentation in Microsoft Word by data sourced live from ADOIT. Customers can create their own template structure for their individual use cases or existing project management templates (e.g. Hermes) and create deliverables automatically. Instead of compiling their lists and data manually, customers can have it automatically inserted and updated from one single reliable source. 

The sales process for the Generator is currently at an Ad-hoc stage, meaning that roles and responsibilities are yet to be defined in order to increase pipeline and ultimately business. Throughout this process, we realized that Ximiq doesn’t have the resources for a dedicated Sales Team and the sales engagement is fully managed by consultants. That’s the reason why we need to implement a lean and streamlined process to better allocate resources.

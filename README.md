# Introduction
This document describes the contribution to the process from the company Ximiq AG as part of the course "Digitalization of Business Processes" at the University of Applied Sciences and Arts North-western Switzerland. 


# Description of the Use Case 

Ximiq was founded in 2013 as a Consulting Firm with the objective of working with customer as partners. The aim of Ximiq is to align Business and IT. This is done through Enterprise Architecture Management. While supporting one of their customers in EAM, Ximiq realized the need to automatically generate reports from the Enterprise Architecture Modelling Tools. At this point, Ximiq developed the ADOIT Report Generator for Microsoft Word. Thanks to the ADOIT Report Generator for Word customers are able to flexibly and quickly create architecture documentation in Microsoft Word by data sourced live from ADOIT. Customers can create their own template structure for their individual use cases or existing project management templates (e.g. Hermes) and create deliverables automatically. Instead of compiling their lists and data manually, customers can have it automatically inserted and updated from one single reliable source.

The sales process for the Generator Software is currently at an Ad-hoc stage, meaning that roles and responsibilities are yet to be defined in order to increase pipeline and ultimately business. Throughout this process, we realized that Ximiq doesn‚Äôt have the resources for a dedicated Sales Team and the sales engagement is fully managed by consultants. That is the reason why Ximiq needs to implement a lean and streamlined process to better allocate resources.  

 
# AS-IS Process Description 

The Sales Process is triggered by three Events:

1. A potential customer downloads the Report Generator in the AppSource Marketplace from Microsoft.
2. A potential customer sends a request for the Report Generator through the BOC-Marketplace which results in an E-Mail sent to Ximiq AG.
3. A Reseller/Partner or one of the Ximiq-Consultants refers the Report Generator to a customer. This is done by sending an email, a chat message or a call.

The first event automatically creates a new Lead in Ximiqs CRM-System. Since there‚Äôs no notification, the new leads must be checked. After the other two events, a new lead must be created. Then an initial email with the following content is sent: 

- A link to book a live demo
- Mention of the possibility to request a trial-License
- The pricing model

If the customer requests a live demo, an appointment will be automatically generated. The live demo takes place. If the customer requests a trial license, the license will be sent to them. After 30 days, another reminder email including the price information is sent to the customer. If there is still no feedback, after 14 days, the lead is closed as lost.

However, if the customer orders the full license, the deal is registered in the CRM and the pricing is calculated based on the type of license chosen and the size of the customer in terms of number users. The accountant is then informed in order to create a new invoice based on the information registered in the CRM. The accountant forwards the invoice to the consultant who will then send it to the customer. If the customer doesn‚Äôt pay the invoice, an email reminder is sent by the consultant. Should there not be feedback from the customer, the lead is closed as lost.

However, if the customer does pay the invoice, the full license key is generated and then sent to the customer. In this case, the opportunity is closed as won.

At any point of this process, the customer can always purchase the license, the process resumes on the step ‚ÄúRegister order in CRM‚Äù.

When the Apples Group met with Ximiq, they discovered that their business process did not have any process model  or workflow integration behind. Therefore, the Group created a best effort AS-IS BPMN process with the information they received from Ximiq. BPMN stands for Business Process Model and Notation. It is a standardized graphical notation used for modeling business processes in a visual format. BPMN provides a set of symbols and rules to represent various elements of a business process, such as activities, events, gateways, and flows. Overall, BPMN helps organizations improve process efficiency, identify bottlenecks, and streamline operations by providing a clear and standardized representation of business processes.

| 1   | ![AS-IS-PROCESS/SCREENSHOTS-PROCESS-ELEMENTS/ASIS01.png](https://github.com/DigiBP/Team-Apples/blob/c359fb74a7a2e72c2f18677aa13f3012f2183d54/AS-IS-PROCESS/Screenshots-Process-Elements/ASIS01.png) | Potential customers can download the application in the Microsoft AppSource Marketplace. It can be installed and added to Microsoft Word but has to be activated by a license key before its usable. https://smp-prod-pb-cac.azurewebsites.net/en-us/product/office/WA200004614?tab=Overview&exp=ubp8   |  | 
| 2   | ![AS-IS-PROCESS/SCREENSHOTS-PROCESS-ELEMENTS/ASIS02.png](https://github.com/DigiBP/Team-Apples/blob/c359fb74a7a2e72c2f18677aa13f3012f2183d54/AS-IS-PROCESS/Screenshots-Process-Elements/ASIS02.png) | Potential customers can request the application via the BOC-Marketplace. BOC is the company that develops ADOIT. This will generate an email sent to Ximiq. The following is the content of the email: Form of address, First Name, Last Name, Email, Organization, Country, Telephone, Messsage.  https://knowledge.boc-group.com/de/module/adoit-word-report-generator/ | This doesn‚Äôt automatically trigger the creation of a Lead in CRM | 
| 3   | ![AS-IS-PROCESS/SCREENSHOTS-PROCESS-ELEMENTS/ASIS03.png](https://github.com/DigiBP/Team-Apples/blob/c359fb74a7a2e72c2f18677aa13f3012f2183d54/AS-IS-PROCESS/Screenshots-Process-Elements/ASIS03.png) | Ximiq has several partners (other consultants and resellers of ADOIT) who recommend the Report Generator to their customers. Requests from them arrive via various channels (email, phone, teams chat or verbal). | This doesn‚Äôt automatically trigger the creation of a Lead in CRM and is difficult to automate since the data input is unstructured.  | 
| 4   | ![AS-IS-PROCESS/SCREENSHOTS-PROCESS-ELEMENTS/ASIS04.png](https://github.com/DigiBP/Team-Apples/blob/c359fb74a7a2e72c2f18677aa13f3012f2183d54/AS-IS-PROCESS/Screenshots-Process-Elements/ASIS04.png) | If a potential customer downloads the application in the Microsoft AppSource Marketplace, a new lead is automatically generated in Ximiqs CRM-System (Microsoft Dynamics) via API.  | No message for the consultant. Quality of entry is not sufficient yet but can be fixed.    | 
| 5   | ![AS-IS-PROCESS/SCREENSHOTS-PROCESS-ELEMENTS/ASIS05.png](https://github.com/DigiBP/Team-Apples/blob/c359fb74a7a2e72c2f18677aa13f3012f2183d54/AS-IS-PROCESS/Screenshots-Process-Elements/ASIS05.png) | Since there is no message arriving when leads are generated, the consultants have to check whether new leads arrived and if the entries are of good quality.   | This process step is a waste that can be eliminated by automatically informing the consultant when a new lead is created. | 
| 6   | ![AS-IS-PROCESS/SCREENSHOTS-PROCESS-ELEMENTS/ASIS06.png](https://github.com/DigiBP/Team-Apples/blob/c359fb74a7a2e72c2f18677aa13f3012f2183d54/AS-IS-PROCESS/Screenshots-Process-Elements/ASIS06.png) | In the cases when the leads aren‚Äôt generated automatically a consultant creates a new lead in CRM.  | This can be automated with no human involvement.| 
| 7   | ![AS-IS-PROCESS/SCREENSHOTS-PROCESS-ELEMENTS/ASIS07.png](https://github.com/DigiBP/Team-Apples/blob/c359fb74a7a2e72c2f18677aa13f3012f2183d54/AS-IS-PROCESS/Screenshots-Process-Elements/ASIS07.png) | In all cases an initial email with the following content is sent to the customer : Download-link, Pricing information, Trial information, Technical questions, Link to book a live demo appointment   | Since it‚Äôs a standard email for any customer this process step can be automized. | 
| 8   | ![AS-IS-PROCESS/SCREENSHOTS-PROCESS-ELEMENTS/ASIS08.png](https://github.com/DigiBP/Team-Apples/blob/c359fb74a7a2e72c2f18677aa13f3012f2183d54/AS-IS-PROCESS/Screenshots-Process-Elements/ASIS08.png) | When clicking the link in the initial email a customer gets access to a booking tool connected to the customers outlook calendar. The following content appears in the booking tool:  dropdown to choose a consultant, free slots for live demo, Name, Email, Address, Phone number, Notes, ADOIT Version (OnPremis/Cloud) | This is an automated form which could be integrated into the Groups solution. Since there are some limitations, this form will not be used in this solution.   | 
| 9   | ![AS-IS-PROCESS/SCREENSHOTS-PROCESS-ELEMENTS/ASIS09.png](https://github.com/DigiBP/Team-Apples/blob/c359fb74a7a2e72c2f18677aa13f3012f2183d54/AS-IS-PROCESS/Screenshots-Process-Elements/ASIS09.png) | If the customer sends the form an appointment and a Teams call link is automatically generated in Outlook. https://outlook.office365.com/owa/calendar/Sales1@ximiq.ch/bookings/  (do not book a live demo!)  |  This is an automated form which could be integrated into the Groups solution.  | 
| 10  | ![AS-IS-PROCESS/SCREENSHOTS-PROCESS-ELEMENTS/ASIS10.png](https://github.com/DigiBP/Team-Apples/blob/c359fb74a7a2e72c2f18677aa13f3012f2183d54/AS-IS-PROCESS/Screenshots-Process-Elements/ASIS10.png) | The potential customer has the chance to book an appointment via booking-link from the initial email. |  |
| 11  | ![AS-IS-PROCESS/SCREENSHOTS-PROCESS-ELEMENTS/ASIS11.png](https://github.com/DigiBP/Team-Apples/blob/c359fb74a7a2e72c2f18677aa13f3012f2183d54/AS-IS-PROCESS/Screenshots-Process-Elements/ASIS11.png) | The live demo is held via Teams. In this call the consultant demonstrates the generator and answers the customers questions. |   | 
| 12  | ![AS-IS-PROCESS/SCREENSHOTS-PROCESS-ELEMENTS/ASIS12.png](https://github.com/DigiBP/Team-Apples/blob/c359fb74a7a2e72c2f18677aa13f3012f2183d54/AS-IS-PROCESS/Screenshots-Process-Elements/ASIS12.png) | The potential customer has the chance to request a 30days trial license to try out the ADOIT Report Generator for Word.  |  | 
| 13  | ![AS-IS-PROCESS/SCREENSHOTS-PROCESS-ELEMENTS/ASIS13.png](https://github.com/DigiBP/Team-Apples/blob/c359fb74a7a2e72c2f18677aa13f3012f2183d54/AS-IS-PROCESS/Screenshots-Process-Elements/ASIS13.png) | After sending the initial email Ximiq waits two weeks for an answer. |   | 
| 14  | ![AS-IS-PROCESS/SCREENSHOTS-PROCESS-ELEMENTS/ASIS14.png](https://github.com/DigiBP/Team-Apples/blob/c359fb74a7a2e72c2f18677aa13f3012f2183d54/AS-IS-PROCESS/Screenshots-Process-Elements/ASIS14.png) | If the customer doesn‚Äôt answer within two weeks a reminder/follow-up email is sent. | This process step could be eliminated as it is over-processing. If client is interested they would come back.   | 
| 15  | ![AS-IS-PROCESS/SCREENSHOTS-PROCESS-ELEMENTS/ASIS15.png](https://github.com/DigiBP/Team-Apples/blob/c359fb74a7a2e72c2f18677aa13f3012f2183d54/AS-IS-PROCESS/Screenshots-Process-Elements/ASIS15.png) | After sending the reminder email Ximiq waits two weeks for an answer.  |   |

| 17  | ![AS-IS-PROCESS/SCREENSHOTS-PROCESS-ELEMENTS/ASIS17.png](https://github.com/DigiBP/Team-Apples/blob/c359fb74a7a2e72c2f18677aa13f3012f2183d54/AS-IS-PROCESS/Screenshots-Process-Elements/ASIS17.png) | The Trial license key is generated via https://guidgenerator.com/ and registered in Postman. The license key is a 32 digit number.  | This process step could be automated.  | 
| 18  | ![AS-IS-PROCESS/SCREENSHOTS-PROCESS-ELEMENTS/ASIS18.png](https://github.com/DigiBP/Team-Apples/blob/c359fb74a7a2e72c2f18677aa13f3012f2183d54/AS-IS-PROCESS/Screenshots-Process-Elements/ASIS18.png) | The license key and a users handbook is sent to the customer by email.   | This process step could be automated.   |

# AS-IS Business Process Problems 
When analysing the AS-IS process to do a lean process improvement several questions came up. 
- First of all Ximiq has a lot of wastes in its sales process. 
- Besides some automated tasks in the process most of the tasks are manually and the clients have no added value for themselves. 
- The only value adding tasks in the process are the Demo done by the Consultant for the client, the license keys the client receives and the price information. 
- There is a lot of transportation wast, wasted potentials of Consultants and Accountants, waiting time for the client and over-processing such as sending reminders to clients. 
- The 3 trigger points seem not to be synchronized and needs to be merged at some point manually. 
- Accounting seems to do everything manually and there is again a transportation between Accounting and Consulting department. 
- Several tasks are not automated and the Consultants do not receive any reminders to make sure to contact the client after e.g. 30 days of trial phase.

# Make (formerly Integromat) - Scenarios
In order to automate the above TO-BE BPMN process's service tasks and message events, Integromat was utilized to visually create, build, and automate the workflow. The workflow entails coordinating humans, resources, and information to achieve a specific objective. Each task or activity within the workflow relies on the successful completion of preceding tasks or the occurrence of specific events, such as receiving a lead from a potential client.

In Integromat, scenarios are created using the process engine and added to the "external task list". An external worker then queries the topic, locks the task, performs the necessary work, and completes the service task within Camunda BPMN. On the other hand, user tasks are directly handled by the BPMN engine.


## 1. Start Event - Software request received
- When client decides to request the software, they will fill in a Google Form as a starting point.
- The starting scenario involves watching for new rows in a Google Sheet, which serves as the CRM (Customer Relationship Management) system for Ximiq.
- When a new row is detected in the Google Sheet, a process instantiation is triggered via a REST call. This means that an instance of a process model in Camunda is created to handle the workflow for the new data.
- As part of the process instantiation, a new business key is generated. The business key is a unique identifier associated with the process instance and can be used for tracking or referencing purposes.
- The information related to the new business key is then sent via an external worker to Camunda. The external worker acts as an interface between the external systems (such as the Google Sheet) and Camunda, allowing for the execution of specific tasks within the workflow.
- Once Camunda receives the information about the new business key from the external worker, it can start managing the workflow according to the defined process model. The process instance can proceed with invoking the first external services task "Sent free license key URL".

### Google Form

## 2. Sent e-mail with URL links
- When a new registry is added to the CRM system, a trigger is initiated.
- An email is automatically generated using the "Send an Email" module. The email includes details retrieved from the CRM, such as customer information, order details, or any other relevant data.
- The email is sent to the client without any human interaction. This step is automated, meaning that the system handles it automatically without requiring manual intervention.
- After sending the email, the workflow proceeds to the next step, which involves making an HTTP request to fetch and lock information from Camunda BPMN engine.
- The fetched information is then used to complete the service task.
- Once the service task is completed, the resulting information or outcome is sent back to Camunda. This allows Camunda to update the process instance's state and continue with the workflow, in this case the next event is the message intermediate catch event "Free trial License order received" which waits for a message to be received. 

### Scenario
![TO-BE-PROCESS/MAKE-Screenshots/2. Sent e-mail with URL links.png](https://github.com/DigiBP/Team-Apples/blob/53080c6a715c2e99104000f13f0dffe02d081155/TO-BE-PROCESS/MAKE-Screenshots/2.%20Sent%20e-mail%20with%20URL%20links.png)

### First E-mail to client with Google Form URL
- The e-mail always refers to the Chatbot in case the client has issues or questions they can get in touch with the Chatbot.

## 3. Order free trial license key message
- The client is given the option to request a free trial license via Google Form.
- The "Watch New Row" module detects the new entry in Google Sheet.
- The intermediate catching message event in Camunda serves as a waiting state for a specific message to arrive. In this case, it is waiting for the message indicating the client's request for a free trial license via a message post.
- Once the intermediate catching message event is triggered, Camunda captures the event and continues with the workflow. 

### Google Form

## 4. Generate free trial license
- The free trial license is being generated using a UUID (Universally Unique Identifier). A UUID is a unique identifier that ensures each generated license has a distinct value.
- After generating the free trial license with the UUID, the generated license information is written back into the CRM (Customer Relationship Management) system.
- Writing the license information back into the CRM allows for proper tracking and management of the free trial licenses. It ensures that the generated licenses are associated with the respective clients or organizations.
- The CRM system can store the generated license information, including the UUID, client details, and any other relevant information tied to the free trial license.

### Scenario

## 5. Sent free trial license
- The process starts with an HTTP make a request step, where Integromate makes a request to fetch and lock relevant information, including the license key, from a Google Sheet or CRM system.
- The HTTP request fetches the necessary details from the Google Sheet or CRM system, such as the client's information and the generated license key.
- Once the information is retrieved, Camunda proceeds with the workflow and uses the obtained data.
- As part of the workflow, an email is automatically sent to the client immediately as soon as the preceding scenario is finished. 
- The Custom Webhook assures a smooth and faster sending of the License Key E-mail.
- The email content is composed using the retrieved details from the Google Sheet or CRM, and it includes the generated free license key.

### E-mail Free Trial License Key
- The e-mail always refers to the Chatbot in case the client has issues or questions they can get in touch with the Chatbot.

<img src="https://github.com/DigiBP/Team-Apples/blob/e0b465c7025875559349c3bf35189fb21940c24e/TO-BE-PROCESS/E-Mail-Schreenshots/05_Fee%20Trial%20License%20Key.png"  width="50%" height="50%">


## 6. Sent License key order form URL
- The client has a 30-day free trial license and once that is expired this scenario calculates with "Tool" modules the number of remaining days. 
- It calculates today minus the license start date and defines if it is expired or not.
- Once the remaining days are zero, an email is automatically sent to the client.
- The email contains a URL that directs the client to a Google form where they can order the one-year license key.

## 8. Create Invoice and send
- The scenario initiates an HTTP make a request step to fetch and lock the business key and topic name from Camunda. This step allows the workflow to access the necessary information for further processing.
- With the fetched information, the scenario proceeds to create an Invoice Number. This could involve generating a unique identifier or following a specific numbering scheme.
- Additionally, the scenario generates a Barcode associated with the invoice. This Barcode serves as a reference for scanning purposes.
- The Barcode is saved in Google Drive. This step ensures that the Barcode is securely stored and can be easily accessed or referenced later in the payment information.
- The scenario continues by creating an invoice using the generated Invoice Number and Barcode. The invoice contains relevant details such as client ID, product name, pricing, and Invoice Number. 
- The created invoice is saved as a PDF file. This allows for easy sharing, printing, and archiving of the invoice document.
- The scenario writes back the Invoice Number and the document ID of the saved invoice in Google Sheet. This step updates the Google Sheet with the relevant invoice information for tracking and reference purposes.
- An email is then sent to the recipient, attaching the generated invoice as a PDF file. The e-mail includes the details of the payment. 
- Finally, the scenario completes the process with another HTTP make a request, indicating the successful completion of the workflow.

# Conclusion 
The process has been improved massively and if Ximiq would give the Group Apples the time used for each user task the Group could have calculated the 
Flow Efficiency (%) = Value added Time   / Process Lead Time (total time needed to fulfill a customer order) 
Looking at all the manual tasks that probably costed a lot of time the flow efficiency with the TOBE process is massivelly better than the AS-IS process.
